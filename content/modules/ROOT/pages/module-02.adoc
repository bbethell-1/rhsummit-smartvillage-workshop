== About the smart village operator

The link:https://github.com/smartabyar-smartvillage/smartvillage-operator[smart village operator] packages up a number of the services needed to implement a smart city that we discussed in the last lab. Operators automate the deployment process for Openshift Container Platform, and this automation lets us deploy all the services needed in this lab easily.

For this lab however, we have already done this part for you (partly just to limit the complications and risk for a lab setting). But we will review the lab environment and the different components that are provided from this operator, and give you a chance to poke and examine each one.


IMPORTANT: The smart village platform deployed for this lab is a shared platform. Please keep that in mind and don't disrupt the platform for others.


=== Technologies deployed

The following technologies that we will be using during this workshop include

link:_images/openshift-ai-code-generation-topology.png[image:_images/openshift-ai-code-generation-topology.png[Smart Device API Code Generation with AI/ML Topology]]

* MongoDB: 

A MongoDB No-SQL Database is required for FIWARE IoT Agents to store smart device registration data about each smart device in the project. Each smart device that we register in the application is stored as a record in MongoDB. We store multiple vehicle traffic camera devices, and multiple pedestrian traffic cameras as individual smart device records in the IoT Agent, which stores the data in MongoDB.

The details of how MongoDB works aren't significant for this lab, but you can link:https://www.mongodb.com/["learn more from Mongo"].

* RabbitMQ:

A message broker like RabbitMQ can receive messages from smart devices and forward them on to an IoT Agent to process the message.

You also will not need to know the he details of how RabbitMQ for this lab, but you can learn more from RabbitMQ.

* PostgreSQL: 

A relational SQL database like PostgreSQL is required by the ScorpioBroker to store smart device context data for each smart device.

PostgreSQL is a commmon open source database and again details of its operation aren't significant for this lab, but you can learn more from link:https://www.postgresql.org/["PostgreSQL'].

* ScorpioBroker:

A FIWARE Context Broker like ScorpioBroker is required for storing smart device entity data of vehicle traffic cameras and pedestrian traffic cameras in the project. It is the heart of the open data exchange that is the foundation of a smart city. O

* IoT Agent JSON:

A FIWARE IoT Agent like IoT Agent JSON is required for smart device registration of vehicle traffic cameras and pedestrian traffic cameras in the project.

* Apache Zookeeper:

A cluster manager like Apache Zookeeper is required for distributing messages and workloads to multiple pods of reactive/asynchronous microservices like Apache Solr and the Smart Village Platform.


* Apache Solr:

An open source search engine like Apache Solr is required by the Smart Village application API to serve up API stored objects as quickly as possible.

* Smart Village Platform:

The Smart Village Platform is used by researchers to configure smart devices for improving traffic light configuration, and running on reports on traffic simulations configured at intersections in the world.

== Examine these deployed components


=== The context broker 

Because its a central component to the FiWARE smart cities, we'l take a little more time examining the context broker.

The jobs of a context broker are to query the state of a smart device, perform an action on a device, or update the state of a device. Smart cities need open data and open source context brokers to avoid being locked into a single device provider. Cities are built over a long course of time -- maybe even over centuries or millennia; and while smart devices probably will not last that long they will be rolled out in stages as services modernize, technologies mature, new city management challenges arise, or citizens demand more from their existing services. Phases or roll outs will undoubtably come from different IT and infrastructure vendors utilizing an array of technology implementations. Only with open standards for the data, the data formats, and the implementations that handle these data can we hope to integrate the huge diversity we expect to encounter .

A context broker receives messages from smart devices to update the device state, or perform some kind of action on the device. FiWARE provides several compatiable implementations, and for this lab we will use the Scorpio Context Broker which provides a REST API that is based on the NGSI-LD standard for smart device data with many features. You can find the full [NGSI-LD API Operation Definition in section 5 of this PDF]. NGSI-LD stores entities as the primary data stored. Entities can be any data representing any Smart Device Model data in the world.  You can create your own smart data models and follow the NGSI-LD specification to confirm to all the latest open standards for managing smart device data.

A sample of what the context broker can do is creating, updating, and deleting entities, creating, updating, and deleting attributes within those entities, querying entities and attributes, and subscribing to entity data changes in other applications through REST webhooks or messages.

By following these NGSI-LD standards, and putting a context broker into your system design, you become part of the trusted FIWARE community. The FIWARE community is an open community supporting these standards, and builds expertise and a marketplace for other organizations following the same standards. NEC is a company following all these FIWARE standards, and we will use NEC's ScorpioBroker as the context broker in this Smart Village application. We have also easily built in support for other context brokers, like the Orion-LD Context broker, since they follow the same NGSI-LD spec. But we prefer the ScorpioBroker for it's use of scalable Quarkus Supersonic Subatomic Java as the codebase, PostgreSQL as the database, and Kafka as the optional message broker.


=== Your Scorpio Context Broker

You should have already have the Scorpio Context Broker installed for you as part of the the initial lab setup but we will take a closer look at it and then test to make sure it is working as we expect it.
