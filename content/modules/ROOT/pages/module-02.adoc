= Installation and Prerequisites



== Deploy the smart city components

From the first lab module, you should have logged into your Openshift AI platform workbench. 

== Using an OpenShift AI Python Workbench

In this lab, we will be making use of the Openshift AI workbench to create our application using Ansible Automation that allows us to easily customize a standard deployment to your specific project's namespace and permissions.  Openshift AI already has the python oriented development tools but we will need to install additional components in order to make this process work, and a jupyter notebook that helps you walk through and undestand the process.

=== Clone the workshop git repository

The necessary automation for this process is available in the same source repository this lab is located in. In a terminal and with git, we clone the course materials to the default home directory (/opt/app-root/src) of your workbench. *It is recommended* that you use a terminal from the workbench using the process described in the previous model -- it will already be in the correct workspace and the content will be placed in the expected container.

TIP: If this asks you for authentication, enter your GitHub username and password. 

----
git clone https://github.com/smartabyar-smartvillage/rhsummit-smartvillage-workshop.git

ln -s rhsummit-smartvillage-workshop/content/modules/ROOT/assets/notebooks workshop-files

A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive, online notebook, and the primary content of this module be found in the Jupyter Notebook.

* In your workbench, make sure your left sidebar is open. If itâ€™s not, press [ Ctrl ] + [ b ].

* Navigate to folder `workshop-files` in the workbench file navigator.

* Open the first Notebook `install-prerequisities.ipynb` and follow the instructions from there.

* Then Open the first Notebook `deploy-microservices.ipynb` and follow the instructions from there. 


IMPORTANT: 
When you finish with these notebooks, return here.

=== Technologies deployed

The following technologies that we will be using during this workshop include

               openshift-ai-code-generation-topology.png
image::_images/openshift-ai-code-generation-topology.png[Smart Device API Code Generation with AI/ML Topology]

* *MongoDB*
+
A MongoDB No-SQL Database is required for FIWARE IoT Agents to store smart device registration data about each smart device in the project. Each smart device that we register in the application is stored as a record in MongoDB. We store multiple vehicle traffic camera devices, and multiple pedestrian traffic cameras as individual smart device records in the IoT Agent, which stores the data in MongoDB.
+
The details of how MongoDB works aren't significant for this lab, but you can link:https://www.mongodb.com/[learn more from Mongo].
+
* *RabbitMQ*
+
A message broker like RabbitMQ can receive messages from smart devices and forward them on to an IoT Agent to process the message. 
+
Smart devices often support sending AMQP or MQTT protocol messages. RabbitMQ supports AMQP, but the full MQTT *version 5 specification* used by FIWARE components is not yet supported in RabbitMQ, though is due to be released in RabbitMQ version 3.13, see link:https://www.rabbitmq.com/versions.html[the RabbitMQ releases] and link:https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2023/07/mqtt5/[the RabbitMQ post on MQTT 5]. link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-amq-broker[Red Hat AMQ Broker] is another message broker that link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2791941#standards-and-network-protocols-15[supports AMQP and MQTT version 5].
+
For this lab, our service definition defines the memory and CPU requests and limits for our RabbitMQ pod. We have to keep this lower than recommended for a production deployment because we have limited resources available in the lab environment for the many running Smart Village services.
+
You also will not need to know the he details of how RabbitMQ for this lab, but you can learn more from link:https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ].

* *PostgreSQL*
+
A relational SQL database like PostgreSQL is required by the ScorpioBroker to store smart device context data for each smart device. We also store configurable user data like traffic simulations, simulation reports, and more in the Smart Village application with PostgreSQL.
+
A relational database like PostgreSQL is where live persistent data in an application belongs. The Smart Village Platform uses two separate tools for storing data, including a *relational database* and a *search engine*. Some data in the Smart Village Platform is stored in the relational database as normalized data and in the search engine as denormalized data in the same database transaction.
--
** Normalized data in the relational database is the raw input data received without any additional calculations from the input data being stored.
+
** Denormalized data in the search engine is based off of the normalized data in the relational database, but with additional calculations performed to make it easily queriable with all the data required for display in the API or in a graphical dashboard.
--
+
Some data may come from other sources, in which case it's not necessary to persist the data in the relational database and can be stored only in the search engine for retrieval in the API. PostgreSQL is the very best transactional database with support for IoT device data because it handles geolocation, unstructured, and structured data with confidence and ACID compliance. ACID compliance is a set of database characteristics consisting of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability that ensure that database transactions are completed efficiently. We can take advantage of PostgreSQL in the Smart Village Platform and ScorpioBroker at the same time.
+
PostgreSQL is a common open source database and again details of its operation aren't significant for this lab, but you can learn more from link:https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL].

* *ScorpioBroker*
+
A FIWARE Context Broker like ScorpioBroker is required for storing smart device entity data of vehicle traffic cameras and pedestrian traffic cameras in the project. It is the heart of the open data exchange that is the foundation of a smart city. _We'll dive a bit more into the ScorpioBroker in a moment._

* *IoT Agent JSON*
+
A FIWARE IoT Agent like IoT Agent JSON is required for smart device registration of vehicle traffic cameras and pedestrian traffic cameras in a smart city. _We will discuss the IoT Agent later in the workshop in more detail._

* *Apache Zookeeper*
+
A cluster manager like Apache Zookeeper is required for distributing messages and workloads to multiple pods of reactive/asynchronous microservices like Apache Solr and the Smart Village Platform. Container management platforms are able to distribute the workloads across the underlying infrastructure, and applications like 
+
Zookeeper is an an open source project in the Apache Foundation and you can learn more from link:https://solr.apache.org/[the Solr project itself].

* *Apache Solr*
+
An open source search engine like Apache Solr is required by the Smart Village application API to serve up API stored objects as quickly as possible. APIs that are backed by a search engine have numerous additional benefits compared to an API backed by a traditional relational database. A search engine is always indexed for the fastest data retrieval possible. The advanced data and query parsing of a search engine allows for extremely fast full text search, filtering, and sorting of the data. Search engine data can also be grouped, faceted, and pivoted on, for an advanced set of analytics and statistics on specific data in your query.
+
Solr is an ALSO an open source project in the Apache Foundation and you can learn more from link:https://solr.apache.org/[the Solr project itself]. Support open source organizations like Apache.

* *Smart Village Platform*
+
The Smart Village Platform is used by researchers to configure smart devices for improving traffic light configuration, and running on reports on traffic simulations configured at intersections in the world. FiWARE and other organizations build similar platforms and ecosystem providers that use the same common standards for other platform implementations. _We will discuss the Smart Village Platform used in this workshop in more detail._


=== The context broker 

Because its a central component to the FiWARE smart cities, we'll take a little more time examining the context broker.

The jobs of a context broker are to query the state of a smart device, perform an action on a device, or update the state of a device. Smart cities need open data and open source context brokers to avoid being locked into a single device provider. Cities are built over a long course of time -- maybe even over centuries or millennia; and while smart devices probably will not last that long they will be rolled out in stages as services modernize, technologies mature, new city management challenges arise, or citizens demand more from their existing services. Phases or roll outs will undoubtably come from different IT and infrastructure vendors utilizing an array of technology implementations. Only with open standards for the data, the data formats, and the implementations that handle these data can we hope to integrate the huge diversity we expect to encounter .

A context broker receives messages from smart devices to update the device state, or perform some kind of action on the device. FiWARE provides several compatiable implementations, and for this lab we will use the Scorpio Context Broker which provides a REST API that is based on the NGSI-LD standard for smart device data with many features. You can find the full [NGSI-LD API Operation Definition in section 5 of this PDF]. NGSI-LD stores entities as the primary data stored. Entities can be any data representing any Smart Device Model data in the world.  You can create your own smart data models and follow the NGSI-LD specification to confirm to all the latest open standards for managing smart device data.

A sample of what the context broker can do is creating, updating, and deleting entities, creating, updating, and deleting attributes within those entities, querying entities and attributes, and subscribing to entity data changes in other applications through REST webhooks or messages.

By following these NGSI-LD standards, and putting a context broker into your system design, you become part of the trusted FIWARE community. The FIWARE community is an open community supporting these standards, and builds expertise and a marketplace for other organizations following the same standards. NEC is a company following all these FIWARE standards, and we will use NEC's ScorpioBroker as the context broker in this Smart Village application. We have also easily built in support for other context brokers, like the Orion-LD Context broker, since they follow the same NGSI-LD spec. But we prefer the ScorpioBroker for it's use of scalable Quarkus Supersonic Subatomic Java as the codebase, PostgreSQL as the database, and Kafka as the optional message broker.

Your Scorpio Context Broker is in your namespace and you can we will take a closer look at it and then test to make sure it is working as we expect it to. We will use this context broker later in this lab.

== Your smart city

Congratulations, you have the foundational integration infrastructure so you can start. The assets you have in place are just the start, aimed at laying the integration necessary to connect smart devices and other tools that can use these such as monitoring, mapping, or analytics.

What's next?

=== Other smart city infrastructure

The platform and tools here are generic microservices, though put to specific use in this workshop. But the same infrastructure can be used for other services, tools, and platforms. Your future development and operations

=== Secuity, Governance, and -ilities

We've deployed our microservices mostly with an eye to simplicity and enabling connectivity. As your smart cities platforms moves into production, you need to start protecting your infrastructure and the data and services it uses and provides. Fortunately, Red Hat Openshift Container Platform is ready with more advanced security with link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-advanced-cluster-security-for-kubernetes[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security], enabling advanced patterns like link:https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/zero-trust-openshift-platform-plus-brief[Zero Trust] and advanced management capabilities with link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-for-kubernetes/[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management].
